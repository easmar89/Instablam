# Instablam

_Instablam_ is a webb application that uses your computer/mobile camera to take photos and save them in a gallery. The **live location** of where the photo was taken will be automatically saved as well if the permission was given by the user.
You can then view, download or delete the photos from the gallery, even without having an internet connection.
